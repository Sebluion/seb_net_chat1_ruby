# seb_net_chat1_ruby
A simple TCP server/client thing that doesn't work 50% of the time made using Ruby.

**net_chat_1server.rb** is the *server* and currently only the server can send messages to the clients.
**net_chat_1client.rb** is the *client* that currently only receives messages from a server

The code is bad, messy and mostly uncommented but it kinda works

Todo:
-make client send messages to server because that worked once but broke everything else
-see ip adress of connected clients?
-make code neat
