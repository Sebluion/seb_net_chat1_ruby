# seb_net_chat1_ruby
A simple TCP server/client thing that doesn't work 50% of the time made using Ruby.

**net_chat_1server.rb** is the *server*. It sometimes breaks but thats okay

**net_chat_1client.rb** is the *client*. Client can send messages to server and receive messages from server

The code is bad, messy and mostly uncommented but it kinda works

Todo:

-see ip adress of connected clients?

-make code neat


note to self: dont use threads because it breaks shit
